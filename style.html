        <h7>1. A Website Doesn’t Look Same on Diverse Computer Screens</h7>
Browsers on each device render a website in a different manner. It is this reason, a website that looks a certain way on Google Chrome in desktop computer looks different on Safari in your iPhone.

How a website will look on the screen depends on factors such as parsing and rendering, means how a browser translate the code in a website and display it on your screen.

</p><p class="big">2. Most of the Readers Simply Scan the Website
In research on how people read websites, Nielsen Norman Group found that 79% of test users scanned the website, and only 16% of users read the text word by word.

This means a website must have scannable text, including keywords, sub-headings, bulleted lists, only one idea in a paragraph, and fewer words to enable readers to run through the content.

If a copy is not properly formatted for skimming and scanning, website visitors might lose their interest and skip to the next option in the search result. Good quality graphics, outbound hypertext links, and good writing together forms a great copy.

So if you do not have your own team of copywriters, check with your web development company if they offer such services or you might take help from the external vendors.
